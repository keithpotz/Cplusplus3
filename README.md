CS 250

There are a few different ways that you can interpret user needs. You could do surverys, usability testing, or focus groups. All of these can help you create your user stories. User stories are important because, they help you understand what users are asking for. Then you can disseminate them into working models that help to create the things that end users actually want to see in a deliverable.
Currently I develop my code top down. What I mean by that is I create the outline of my code first. Then start from the top and work my way down. Which in praticallity is not the smartest way to code. I really need to be working in a modular fashion and testing my code each time I add something new. I want to incorporate Scrum into my programming pipeline. I say this because from everything I have learned in this course, Scrum is the easiest to implement and seems to be the most useful. I really think that being a good team member is to communicate effectively with your team. Always being on the same page and really making sure that the deliverables that you are putting out meet the standards and if you can't asking for help and helping others.
